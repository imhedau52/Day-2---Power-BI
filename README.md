When I built that sales report in Power BI, here’s roughly what I did—step by step—from raw data to polished dashboard:
	1.	Data sourcing and import
	•	Connected Power BI Desktop to our sales data source (in my case a SQL database/Excel workbook/CSV files).
	•	Used the Power Query Editor to preview the tables and select only the fields I needed (order date, product, region, sales amount, cost, etc.).
	2.	Data shaping & cleansing
	•	In Power Query I:
	•	Removed any completely empty or obviously erroneous rows.
	•	Filled or filtered out nulls in key columns (e.g. blank “Region” entries got flagged).
	•	Standardized date formats and trimmed text fields (e.g. ensuring “East” and “east” became a single value).
	•	Split or merged columns where necessary (for example, if “Product Code–Name” came in one field, I split it into Product Code and Product Name).
	3.	Data modeling
	•	Established relationships between my tables (e.g. Sales fact table joined to Product lookup table on ProductID, and to Date table on OrderDate).
	•	Added a dedicated Date (calendar) table, marked it as the date table, and related it to the sales table—so I could slice by Year, Quarter, Month, etc.
	4.	Creating measures (DAX)
	•	Wrote DAX measures to calculate:
	•	Total Sales = SUM( Sales[SalesAmount] )
	•	Total Cost = SUM( Sales[Cost] )
	•	Gross Profit = [Total Sales] – [Total Cost]
	•	Year‑over‑Year Growth =
( [Total Sales] – 
  CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])) 
) / 
CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))

	•	Used time‑intelligence functions (SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, TOTALYTD, etc.) so I could show rolling trends and YTD comparisons automatically.

	5.	Building visuals
	•	On the report canvas, arranged:
	•	A line chart showing monthly sales trends over the last 2 years.
	•	A clustered bar chart breaking down sales by region.
	•	A matrix (table) with products down the rows and quarters across the columns.
	•	KPI cards for high‑level metrics: Total Sales, YoY Growth %, Gross Profit Margin.
	•	Applied consistent color formatting (e.g. our brand palette), data labels, and tooltips so each visual is self‑explanatory.
	6.	Drill‑through & interactivity
	•	Enabled cross‑filtering so selecting a region on the map filters all other visuals to that region.
	•	Set up a drill‑through page: right‑click on a product in the main report to jump to a detailed page showing order‑level data for that product.
	7.	Page layout & storytelling
	•	Organized the report into two pages:
	1.	Executive Summary (high‑level KPIs, trends, regional breakdown)
	2.	Detail & Drill‑through (detailed tables, filters for digging in)
	•	Added titles, text boxes with context (“Sales are up 12% this quarter”), and consistent headers/footers.
	8.	Publishing & sharing
	•	Published the report to the Power BI Service (my workspace).
	•	Set up a scheduled data refresh (e.g. daily at 6 am) so the visuals always pull in the latest sales figures.
	•	Shared the dashboard with stakeholders, assigning them appropriate Row‑Level Security roles (so each regional manager only sees their own region’s data).
	9.	Iteration & feedback
	•	After sharing, I gathered feedback (“Can you add a filter for product category?”), then went back into Power BI Desktop to implement those tweaks and republish.

— And that’s my end‑to‑end process, from raw sales data all the way through to a live, interactive Power BI report. Let me know if you’d like more detail on any specific step!
